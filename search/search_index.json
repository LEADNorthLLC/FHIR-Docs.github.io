The only customizing needed for different feed types is in the creation of Operations, which will be covered later on.

This project is a new integration that allows Prisma to support receiving facility charge details from hospitals across the country for anyone with a LOS greater than 10 days, all NICU admits, anyone with facility charges over $10k automatically via inbound FHIR. Intended Audience The intended audience for this document is the technical staff associated with the implementation, support and operational aspects of this solution. Scoping Questions Connectivity: Are we connecting to Prisma (FHIR server/endpoint) to get resources? GET from Prisma? Or POST from Prisma to BCBSSC? How often? Or how is the transaction triggered? Schedule or event-driven. What is the format of the data? What FHIR resources? Bundle? (How many transactions per batch?) Is it a bulk transaction? > 1000 Consider bulk FHIR Any expected normalization? Will the final file be a CSV or Excel? Will the file need to be sent anywhere or stored locally? How many records should be stored in each file? Implementation Strategy Inbound FHIR connection Ingest Itemized Billing Data (ChargeItem Resource) message Transformations and Normalization Transformation to Spreadsheet/Columnar format Possible return message Inbound FHIR Connection For FHIR, for connections outbound (BCBSSC to external FHIR server), we would need the connection details from the provider. STAGE: https://router.stage.sdsexchangeplatform.com/esb PROD: https://router.sdsexchangeplatform.com/esb For connections inbound, external provider to BCBSSC, we would provide the endpoints and SSL certificate. Connection direction Type Endpoint Authentication Outbound GET /chargeitem HTTPS: provide certificates based on exchange direction, additional OAuth or client id/secret? Authentication for FHIR is typically through OAuth and an identify provider. Alternatively, we can provide and maintain login credentials.
